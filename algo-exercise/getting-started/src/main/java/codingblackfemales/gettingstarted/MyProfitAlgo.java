// 8TH AND FINAL CODE
// TRADING ALGO THAT CREATES BUY ORDERS AND CANCELS AN ORDER BASED ON THE SPREAD NARROWING AND EXPANDING
// THE ALGO CAN ALSO MAKE A PROFIT BY BUYING SHARES WHEN PRICES ARE LOW AND SELLING THEM WHEN PRICES ARE HIGH
// IF THE SPREAD NARROWS TO OR BELOW THE SET THRESHOLD, CREATE UP TO 5 BUY ORDERS FOR 200 SHARES PER ORDER,
// FOR EACH UNFILLED/PARTIALLY FILLED BUY ORDER, IF THE BEST ASK PRICE IS ABOVE THE BUY PRICE FOR THAT SPECIFIC
// ORDER, PLUS A SET NUMBER OF POINTS, CANCEL THAT  ORDER
// IF THE BID AND ASK PRICES GO ABOVE YOUR PREVIOUS BOUGHT PRICE BY A CERTAIN THRESHOLD, SELL THE SHARES AT
// CURRENT BEST BID PRICE WITH THE AIM OF MAKING A PROFIT
